# Image Editing Scripts
For a while I was playing around with Python scripts for image editing like this one that used ImageMagicK to produce better color mapping and dithering results.
I have since found better tools and approaches for doing the kind of palette mapping and dither effects I was after.
e.g. https://simonsanchezart.gumroad.com/l/magnolia-for-aseprite
May collect and document more alternatives in the future, e.g. popular Unity Shaders, etc.
